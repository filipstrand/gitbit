A simple, powerful Git Graph for Cursor and VS Code, inspired by JetBrains IDEs.

GitBit provides a lightweight and performant way to visualize your repository's history, manage branches, and perform complex Git operations like squashing directly from a beautiful graph interface.

## ✨ Features

- **Clean Graph**: A clean, topological visualization of your local and remote commits.
- **Side-by-Side Details**: Instantly see commit metadata and changed files in a dedicated details pane.
- **Advanced Squashing**: Select a range of commits and squash them with a single click, including automatic rebasing and commit message prompts.
- **Drop Commits**: Select one or multiple commits and drop them safely (with confirmation + automatic rollback on failure).
- **Branch Management**: Effortlessly switch branches, create new ones, and see your current context at a glance.
- **Tag Management**: Add tags to commits, delete tags via a flyout submenu, and push tags even when your branch is up to date.
- **Integrated Diff View**: Deep integration with native VS Code diffing for a seamless experience.
- **Reveal in Finder**: Reveal changed files in Finder/Explorer from the details pane.
- **Move Mode**: Reorder history with a drag-and-drop “move mode” UI.
- **Performance First**: Optimized for repositories of all sizes, with a focus on smooth scrolling and interaction.
- **Theme-Aware**: Automatically matches your Cursor or VS Code theme.

## 💡 Feature Requests

- **Infinite Scroll**: Fetch more than 500 commits automatically when scrolling to the bottom of the graph.
- **Branch Existence Check**: Show a popup notification if trying to create a branch that already exists.
- **Auto-Rebase on Pull**: Automatically perform a rebase during pull if it can be done safely.

## 🐛 Known Bugs

- Weird behavior sometimes when committing and getting `ruff` errors.
